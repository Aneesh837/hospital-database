This project showcases a simple hospital database implemented using SQL, designed to manage patient and doctor records, appointments, and treatments efficiently. The database includes four tables: 
Patients, which stores details like name, date of birth, gender, and contact information; 
Doctors, which holds information about doctors and their specializations; 
Appointments, which tracks schedules and reasons for patient-doctor visits; and 
Treatments, which logs treatment details and dates. 
The script provides sample data for each table and includes multiple queries to demonstrate common database operations, such as retrieving patient information, finding specialists, counting records, and listing appointments or treatments. This project serves as a foundational example for healthcare database management systems.
